Cipher.io Groups Server
================

Cipher.io Groups is a secure messaging platform that utilizes 256-bit AES encrypted before leaving the app, on top of traditional SSL. Messages snooped on WIFI, or obtained through the server database are still safe. Access to a group (and AES key) is granted via a physical NFC "tap" with other privileges.

The main cipher.io server will support push notifications and live updates. I thought it would be cool to have a slimmer easy-to-install self-hosted option for increased flexibility/privacy. This will use polling rather than push notifications.
